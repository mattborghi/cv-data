\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{Introduction}
As a deep learning, finance and data enthusiast I found myself quite thrilled to see your quantitative research opening. Having experience in several programming languages and working in the financial industry made me consider myself as a fit candidate for the job. 


\lettersection{Why \company?}
During my previous role at Crisil, I have been working as a quantitative researcher but given that my current employer wasn't much motivated to change their line of business, I have decided to pursue the same career path elsewhere. Along these years we formed a really good interdisciplinary collaborative team that worked flawlessly independently or in small groups in order to achieve the project goals. 

In the short term, I will be working as a consultant with a tier-1 US investment bank with my current employer but I prefer that my future lay in the research area.
Given that I am looking for a relocation opportunity in addition to the fact that I love Quantitative Research, I didn't think twice about applying for the job position.


\lettersection{Why Me?}
Although I am not a NLP expert, I have found myself several times having to deal with work uncertainty but I know that I have the tools to succeed. For example, during my work as a Quantitative Research I was offered to do a demo that had to be done in record-time in order to be presented in a conference and having a very basic understanding about web app development  was not an obstacle, given its successful implementation.

As a person that likes to keep learning continuously I find myself doing online courses and, lately, motivated by the pandemics, attending conferences or talks of interest. Right now I am trying to take my knowledge on Microservices/Full Stack tech into AI by studying MLOps.

I would enjoy having the opportunity to discuss my application with you and how I could use my skills to benefit \company.
