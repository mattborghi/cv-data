\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{Introduction}
Physicist with 4y+ of professional experience in the finance industry and, in particular, in a R\&D team, looking for a career change into software development which is what I really love doing.


\lettersection{Why \company?}
During my previous role at Crisil, I have been working as a quantitative researcher/developer making high quality libraries but given that my current employer wasn't much interested in changing their line of business, the project didn't continue and right now I find myself doing consulting. Having deeply thought about my career plan, I decided to follow my passion and that's where I found \company. Also, given that I am looking for a relocation opportunity in addition to the fact that I love software development, I didn't think twice about applying for the job position.


\lettersection{Why Me?}
Although I have been programming since I am 15y old, I have found myself with some working challenges that I certainly loved and with a little bit of self-confidence and determination I could arrive to successful outcomes of projects deliverables maintaining always the highest quality and standards. For example, during the years working as a quantitative developer, I formed a really good interdisciplinary collaborative team that worked flawlessly independently or in small groups in order to achieve the project goals. There, I offered myself to do a web app demo that had to be done in record-time in order to be presented in a conference and, having a very basic understanding about front-end development, I was able to develop an excellent platform surpassing all expectations. 

As a person that likes to keep learning continuously I find myself doing online courses and, lately, motivated by the pandemics, attending conferences or talks of interest. Right now, I am trying to take my knowledge on micro-services and Full Stack tech into AI by studying MLOps.

I would enjoy having the opportunity to discuss my application with you and how I could use my skills to benefit \company.
